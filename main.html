        Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, 
        in order to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural features and human-built structures.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this type, 
        documenting the most remarkable man-made creations of classical antiquity; 
        it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and as such only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in the ancient Near East. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty,
         and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times (five) plus the Sun and Moon

    The Greek historian Herodotus (484 – c. 425 BC) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (c. 305–240 BC), at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders.
     These lists have not survived, however, except as references in other writings

        In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers emulated the classical list by creating their own lists with names such as "Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind", and "Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages".[2] It is unlikely that any of these lists actually originated in the Middle Ages since the concept of a "Middle Age" did not become popular until at least the 16th century and the word "medieval" was not invented until the Enlightenment era. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as "later list[s]",[3] suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.

        <blockquote cite="Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Middle Ages but were well known throughout the world.[4][5] Typically representative of such lists are:["><br/><
           -> Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, a 2nd-century funerary complex in Alexandria, Egypt.<br/>
           -> Colosseum, a 1st-century amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.1<br/>
           ->Great Wall of China, a series of defensive fortifications built across the historical northern borders of China, with some segments dating to as early as the 7th century BC.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/s>
           ->Hagia Sophia, a 6th-century cathedral and mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.<br/>
           ->Leaning Tower of Pisa, a 12th-century bell tower in Pisa, Italy.<br/>
           -> Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, a 15th-century pagoda on the south bank of the external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, People's Republic of China.<br/>
            ->Stonehenge, a Neolithic henge monument in Wiltshire, England dated to the 3rd millennium BC.<br/>
            Other structures sometimes included on such lists include:<br/>

            =>Cluny Abbey, a 10th-century Benedictine monastery in Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, France.<br/>

        Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, and there has been debate over how large such a list should be. One of many existing versions of this list was compiled by CNN in 1997:<br/>
<br/>
*Aurora, in the Earth's high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic)<br/>
*Grand Canyon, in Arizona, United States<br/>
*Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Queensland, Australia<br/>
*Harbor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil<br/>
*Mount Everest, on the border of Nepal and China<br/>
*Parícutin volcano, located in the state of Michoacán, Mexico<br/>
*Victoria Falls, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe<br/>
